## Installation

### Method 1: Via Moodle Plugin Installer (Recommended)

1. Download the plugin ZIP file
2. Log in to your Moodle site as an admin
3. Navigate to **Site administration → Plugins → Install plugins**
4. Upload the ZIP file
5. Click "Install plugin from the ZIP file"

git clone https://github.com/issuebadge/moodle-local_issuebadge.git issuebadge
```

**Note**: The repository follows Moodle's naming convention `moodle-{plugintype}_{pluginname}` (i.e., `moodle-local_issuebadge`), but must be cloned into a folder named `issuebadge` to match Moodle's expected plugin directory structure.

   - Navigate to API settings
   - Copy your Bearer token

2. **Configure Plugin**

## Database Schema

### Tables

**`local_issuebadge_issues`**

## API Endpoints Used

The plugin communicates with IssueBadge API:

- **GET `/badge/getall`**: Retrieve available badge templates
- **POST `/issue/create`**: Issue a badge to a recipient

All requests use Bearer token authentication.

## Privacy (GDPR Compliance)

This plugin is fully compliant with Moodle's Privacy API:

- **Data Stored**: User badge issuance records
- **Data Exported**: Badge IDs, issue IDs, public URLs, timestamps
- **Data Deleted**: User data can be deleted via Moodle's standard privacy tools
- **External Service**: Data (name, email) is sent to IssueBadge API for badge generation

See Privacy Policy: [issuebadge.com/privacy](https://issuebadge.com/privacy)

## Events

### Custom Events

**`\local_issuebadge\event\badge_issued`**
- Triggered when a badge is issued (manually or automatically)
- Can be used by other plugins to react to badge issuance

## Development

### Modern Architecture

This plugin follows Moodle 4.x best practices:

- **Templates**: Mustache templates for all UI components
- **Output API**: Renderable/templatable classes for clean separation
- **AMD JavaScript**: Modern JavaScript with `core/str` module
- **Pagination**: Efficient data loading with proper pagination

For detailed template documentation, see [TEMPLATES_GUIDE.md](TEMPLATES_GUIDE.md).

### Building JavaScript Files

This plugin includes AMD JavaScript modules that require building/minification. The built files are already included in the repository.

**If you modify JavaScript files**, you must rebuild them:

```bash
# From Moodle root directory
npx grunt amd --root=local/issuebadge
```

For detailed instructions, see [BUILDING_JS.md](BUILDING_JS.md).

### Customizing Templates

Themes can override any template by creating:

```
theme/yourtheme/templates/local_issuebadge/{template_name}.mustache
```

Available templates:
- `management_dashboard.mustache` - Management dashboard
- `issue_form.mustache` - Badge issuance form
- `issued_badges_table.mustache` - Issued badges table

### Repository Naming Convention

This plugin follows the Moodle plugin repository naming convention:

- **Repository name**: `moodle-local_issuebadge`
- **Pattern**: `moodle-{plugintype}_{pluginname}`
- **Installation directory**: `/local/issuebadge/`

This naming convention:
- Makes it clear that it's a Moodle plugin
- Identifies the plugin type (`local`) and name (`issuebadge`)
- Provides a consistent experience for Moodle developers
- Follows best practices documented at [Moodle Developer Docs](https://moodledev.io/general/development/policies/codingstyle/frankenstyle#code-repository-name)

2. **Bulk Operations**: Implement bulk badge issuance for entire cohorts
3. **Additional Badge Metadata**: Store and display more badge information
4. **Email Notifications**: Send emails when badges are issued

## Comparison: WordPress vs Moodle Plugin

This Moodle plugin is inspired by the IssueBadge WordPress plugin but adapted for the Moodle LMS:

| Feature | WordPress Plugin | Moodle Plugin |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Platform** | WordPress | Moodle LMS |
| **Architecture** | Singleton class | Local plugin |
| **Database** | Custom table + wp_options | XMLDB tables |
| **AJAX** | wp_ajax_* hooks | External web services |
| **Security** | wp_nonce | sesskey + capabilities |
| **Events** | WordPress hooks | Event observers |
| **Auto-issuance** | Not implemented | Course completion |
| **Context** | Site-wide | Multi-context (system/course) |
| **Users** | WordPress users | Enrolled students |

## Troubleshooting

### Badges Not Loading
- Check that your API token is correct in settings
- Verify the API URL is accessible from your server
- Check Moodle error logs for API errors

### Automatic Issuance Not Working
- Ensure automatic issuance is enabled in plugin settings
- Verify course completion criteria are configured
- Check that a badge is configured for the specific course
- Review event observer logs

### Permission Errors
- Verify user has appropriate capability (issuebadge:issue)
- Check course enrollment and role assignments

### Debug Mode
Enable Moodle debugging:
```php
// In config.php
$CFG->debug = E_ALL;
$CFG->debugdisplay = 1;
```
